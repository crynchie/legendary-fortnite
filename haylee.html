      <h2>Box 1</h2>
        <p>Problem Understanding: The first step is to clearly understand the problem that needs to be solved and the objectives of the system. This includes defining performance metrics such as speedm accuracy, resource usage, and scalability. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="box">
      <h2>Box 2</h2>
        <p>Algorithm Design: Based on the problem understanding, design an algorithm that addresses the requrements while optimizing performance. This may involve choosing the appropriate data structure, selecting efficient algorithm, and designing algorithms with low time and space complexity</p>

  <h2>Karaoke</h2>
    <p> I feel like the biggest misconception about karaoke is that you have to be a good singer to enjoy it. The secret is that you don't have to be good, you just have to be a good performer and it's fun. That said, there are certain songs that are a must when I go and certain songs I think should be banned from karaoke rooms and karaoke stages alike. </p>
